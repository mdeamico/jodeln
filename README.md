# Jodeln
Jodeln is a tool for origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation.

It can:
- Take a network of links and nodes and export shortest routes as a sequence of links and turns.
- Estimate an OD matrix based on a seed matrix and target volumes on link and turns.
- Estimate an OD matrix with multiple user-defined routes between OD pairs.

The code is written in Python 3.
